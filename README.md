# Healthcare Data Classification Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to classify healthcare data. It includes both a Jupyter notebook for detailed exploration and analysis, and an HTML page for presenting the results of the classification model.

## Project Overview

- **Healthcare Data Classification**: Machine learning models are trained to classify healthcare data, predicting various health conditions.
- **Presentation**: The project includes a PowerPoint presentation to display the results and conclusions drawn from the data analysis.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: The notebook includes steps for data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **Model Training**: Machine learning models are applied to classify health data.
- **Presentation Layer**: Results are presented using an HTML file.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mnbl/healthcare-data-classification
   cd healthcare-data-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Project

### Option 1: Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Run the notebook file `Healthcare Data Classification.ipynb` to explore the data and classify healthcare records.

### Option 2: Viewing the HTML Presentation

1. Open `index.html` to view the python notebook in html format.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset:
- `healthcare_dataset.csv`: Contains healthcare data used for classification.
